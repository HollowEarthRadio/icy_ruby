IcyRuby
=======

IcyRuby was developed to connect to a remote shoutcast server and parse out the track titles as the stream plays. This plugin 
will run as a daemon and will update two models (IcyTrack & IcyPlaylist) with information about specific songs being played 
and keeping record of the amount of times they have been played.

Example
=======

To kick off the process for now, do:

script/runner script/start_icy_ruby.rb  RAILS_ENV=development
